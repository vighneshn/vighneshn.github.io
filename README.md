# Vighnesh Natarajan - Personal Website

This is my personal website showcasing my research in quantum computing and trapped ion experiments. The website features an interactive design inspired by ion trap electrodes and includes sections for my projects, about me, resume, and miscellaneous content.

## Features

- **Interactive Design**: Ion trap-inspired UI with animated electrodes
- **Project Showcase**: Detailed project pages with galleries
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Modern Animations**: Smooth transitions using Framer Motion
- **Contact Integration**: Email functionality for easy communication

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
